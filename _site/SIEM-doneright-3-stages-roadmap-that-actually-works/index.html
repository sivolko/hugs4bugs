                <p>Last week I got a situation that stuck me “Why does SIEM  feel like it’s fighting against us instead of helping us”? It’s a fair question. Too many organisations jumps into SIEM implementation assuming they’ll flip a switch and suddenly have perfect visibility. I have been observing since my last 6 years in cybersecurity domain that most of the organisation approach towards SIEM deployment is completly wrong.They are simply adopting facing tools and doing partenership with fancy vendors. The reality?</p>

<p>We all knows or those who got chance to work within SOC might agree with me. Building an effective SIEM is like growing a garden-it takes time, care, planning and understanding what stage you’re in.</p>

<p>Lemme walk through the three stages of SIEM maturity I’ve seen in my working years with security teams and with SANS’s SIEM best practice approach.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: New Deployment-Getting the basics right</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hugs4bugs/image/upload/v1755245541/hugs4bugs/SOC/stage1_sjrflc.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>When you’re starting fresh with a SIEM, resit the urge to collect everything. I’ve seen too many teams drown in their own data because they tried to do too much, too fast. Your soc team might have onboarded SIEM like splunk, ELK stack or maybe it’s cloud native like Microsoft sentinel. Now your maangement is asking when they’ll see ROI and you’re drowing in alerts that might as well be written in ancient Greek.</p>

<p><strong>What to focus on?</strong></p>

<p><em>start small,Think Critical</em></p>

<p>Start with your crown jewels. What systems would make headlines if they got compromised? Your domain controllers, financial databases, customer data repositories - these are your priority targets. Don’t worry about collecting logs from every single workstation yet.</p>

<p>Here’s what I typically recommend for the first phase:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Domain controllers (authentication events)</li>
  <li>Critical database servers (access and query logs)</li>
  <li>External-facing web servers (access logs and application events)</li>
  <li>Firewalls and perimeter security devices</li>
  <li>Key business applications</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Priority 1: Domain Controllers (Security logs, System logs)
Priority 2: Critical application servers (Application logs, Security logs)
Priority 3: Jump boxes and admin workstations (Security logs, PowerShell logs)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Building Your Foundatio</strong></p>

<p>This is where most teams mess up. They skip the boring organisational work and jump straight to writing detection rules. Don’t make this mistake.</p>

<p>Create a naming standard before you deploy anything. When you’re dealing with thousands of devices, “NYC-DC-01” is infinitely more useful than “Shubhendu’s Server.” Trust me on this one.</p>

<p>Your tagging strategy should be simple but consistent. Think about how you’ll search for things six months from now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Environment (Production, Staging, Development)</li>
  <li>Location (if you have multiple sites)</li>
  <li>Criticality (Critical, High, Medium, Low)</li>
  <li>Owner (which team is responsible)</li>
</ul>

<p>Naming the best practice should tell a story e.g.:-</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DC-NYC-PRIMARY instead of WIN-SRV-001

DB-CUSTOMER-PROD instead of SQL-BOX-02

</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Detection and Alerting</strong></p>

<p>High Fidelity First</p>

<p>You’re goal isn’t to catch everything-it’s to catch the things that matter without burning out your team</p>

<p>Expect to spend 60% of your first three months tuning these alerts. That’s normal. Document every tuning decision - your future self will thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Requirements for Stage 1:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Log Agent Deployment</strong></p>

<p>Keep it simple (KISS) approach</p>

<p>Windows: Use the built-in Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) if possible</p>

<p>Linux: Rsyslog or built-in syslog forwarding</p>

<p>Network devices: SIEM vendor’s universal forwarder</p>

<p><strong>Deployment Method</strong>: Manual is fine at this stage. Yes, manual. You need to understand what you’re deploying before you automate it.Later use your existing software deployment tools like SCCM , Group Policy etc to push agents automatically. Since Manual installation doesn’t scale and creates gaps in coverage.</p>

<p>Retention: Start with 90 days of hot storage. You can always adjust later based on your needs and budget.</p>

<p>Alerting: Email notifications are fine initially. Focus on getting the detection logic right before you worry about fancy dashboards.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2: Established Deployments - Scaling Up Intelligently</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hugs4bugs/image/upload/v1755245543/hugs4bugs/SOC/stage2_nj431j.jpg" alt="iamge" /></p>

<p>Once you’ve got your critical systems covered and your team is comfortable with the alert volume, it’s time to expand. But do it strategically.</p>

<p>Expanding Your Collection
Now you can start collecting from riskier systems - the ones that might generate more noise but give you better visibility:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Asset Type</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description / Notes</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Domain Controllers</td>
      <td>Include all, not just primary</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Database Servers</td>
      <td>Include development databases accessing production data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Web Servers &amp; Application Servers</td>
      <td>Ensure coverage of both front-end and back-end services</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Network Appliances</td>
      <td>Firewalls, proxies, load balancers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Desktop Computers</td>
      <td>Prioritize privileged users</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Application Servers</td>
      <td>May be listed separately for emphasis</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Network Appliances (duplicate)</td>
      <td>Load balancers, proxies (already covered above—consider consolidating)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloud Infrastructure Logs</td>
      <td>Include logs from cloud-native services and platforms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The key is to expand gradually. Add one new log source at a time, tune it properly, then move to the next one.</p>

<p><strong>Integration is Everything</strong></p>

<p>This is where your SIEM starts becoming truly powerful. Start connecting it to other security tools:</p>

<p><strong>Asset Knowledge Database Integration</strong>: Your SIEM should know which systems are critical, who owns them, and what they’re used for. When you get an alert from “192.168.1.100,” you should immediately see it’s the HR payroll server</p>

<p><strong>Vulnerability Management Integration</strong>: When your SIEM knows that WEB-PROD-01 has unpatched critical vulnerabilities, that failed login alert suddenly becomes much more interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Alert Queue Management</strong></p>

<p>You now have two types of alerts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>High-fidelity alerts - These wake people up</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medium-fidelity alerts - These get reviewed during business hours</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Storage Strategy: Don’t delete the medium-fidelity stuff. Store it in a “warm” storage tier and review it weekly. You’ll find patterns that inform your high-fidelity rules.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Deployment (Finally!)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>SCCM/Group Policy Deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you can start pushing agents automatically. But please, test in a lab environment first. I once saw an agent update take down half a hospital’s workstations because they didn’t test the new version.</p>

<p><strong>Deployment Strategy</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Test group (5-10 systems)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pilot group (50-100 systems)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phased rollout (25% per week)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full deployment</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Stage 3: Mature Deployments - Advanced Detection and Response</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hugs4bugs/image/upload/v1755245543/hugs4bugs/SOC/stage3_opjrep.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>This is where the magic happens. Your SIEM transforms from a reactive tool into a proactive threat hunting platform.At this stage, you’re collecting logs from everything that matters:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Asset Type</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description / Notes</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Desktops</td>
      <td>Yes, all of them—ensure full endpoint coverage</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Servers</td>
      <td>Includes all production and non-production servers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mobile Device Management (MDM)</td>
      <td>Systems managing mobile endpoints; key for policy enforcement and log collection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mobile Devices</td>
      <td>Covered via MDM integration; includes smartphones and tablets</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloud Services</td>
      <td>AWS CloudTrail, Office 365, Azure, GCP—focus on audit, access, and activity logs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloud Applications &amp; Infrastructure</td>
      <td>SaaS platforms and IaaS/PaaS environments; include identity, storage, compute logs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>IoT Devices</td>
      <td>Printers, security cameras, HVAC systems—often overlooked but critical for visibility</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Operational Technology (OT)</td>
      <td>Industrial control systems, building automation—log collection may require custom setups</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>The Challenge: You’re now ingesting 10TB+ per day. Your old parsing rules don’t scale. Now you can start leveraging the advanced features that seemed like science fiction in Stage 1:</p>

<p><strong>Anomaly Detection with Asset Intelligence</strong>:-</p>

<p>now your SIEM knows what normal looks like for each user and device,When Shubhendu from Seurity team suddently start accessing HR Database at 3 am, your soc team will get alert.</p>

<p><strong>Behavioral Analytics (UEBA)</strong>: Track how users and entities behave over time. Detect insider threats, compromised accounts, and advanced persistent threats that traditional signature-based detection misses.</p>

<p>Machine Learning for Threat Detection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beaconing detection: Identify command and control communication patterns</li>
  <li>DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) detection: Catch malware generating random domains</li>
  <li>Lateral movement detection: Track attackers moving through your network</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SOAR(Security Orchestration and Automated Response) Integration</strong></p>

<p>orchestrate your entire security response. When a high-severity alert fires:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automatically gather additional context</li>
  <li>Check threat intelligence feeds</li>
  <li>Create an incident ticket</li>
  <li>Potentially isolate the affected system</li>
  <li>Notify the appropriate response team</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Dynamic and Self-Healing</strong></p>

<p>Your monitoring infrastructure should adapt automatically. New services get discovered and monitored. Agents self-update and self-heal. The system continuously optimizes itself based on the threats it’s seeing.</p>

<p><strong>Shubhendu’s Tips</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start Small, Think Big</li>
  <li>Don’t try to jump straight to Stage 3. Each stage builds on the previous one. The organizational and technical foundations you build in Stage 1 are what make the advanced capabilities in Stage 3 possible.</li>
  <li>Budget Realistically</li>
  <li>A mature SIEM is expensive - not just in licensing costs, but in staff time, training, and infrastructure. Plan for this from the beginning.</li>
  <li>Focus on Your Use Cases</li>
  <li>
    <p>Every organization is different. Don’t copy past SIEM architecture from online available data, A financial services company has different monitoring needs than a manufacturing plant. Tailor your approach to your specific threats and compliance requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Track metrics that actually matter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mean time to detection (MTTD)</li>
  <li>Mean time to response (MTTR)</li>
  <li>False positive rate</li>
  <li>Alert closure rate</li>
  <li>Analyst satisfaction (yes, this matters!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t get caught up in vanity metrics like “events per second”(EPS) that don’t correlate with security outcomes.The best SIEM in the world is useless if your analysts can’t use it effectively. Invest in training and usable interfaces.Please don’t treat your SIEM as “Set and Forget”, keep tuning, keep learning, keep troubleshooting!</p>

            "articleBody": "Last week I got a situation that stuck me “Why does SIEM  feel like it’s fighting against us instead of helping us”? It’s a fair question. Too many organisations jumps into SIEM implementation assuming they’ll flip a switch and suddenly have perfect visibility. I have been observing since my last 6 years in cybersecurity domain that most of the organisation approach towards SIEM deployment is completly wrong.They are simply adopting facing tools and doing partenership with fancy vendors. The reality?

We all knows or those who got chance to work within SOC might agree with me. Building an effective SIEM is like growing a garden-it takes time, care, planning and understanding what stage you’re in.

Lemme walk through the three stages of SIEM maturity I’ve seen in my working years with security teams and with SANS’s SIEM best practice approach.

Stage 1: New Deployment-Getting the basics right



When you’re starting fresh with a SIEM, resit the urge to collect everything. I’ve seen too many teams drown in their own data because they tried to do too much, too fast. Your soc team might have onboarded SIEM like splunk, ELK stack or maybe it’s cloud native like Microsoft sentinel. Now your maangement is asking when they’ll see ROI and you’re drowing in alerts that might as well be written in ancient Greek.

What to focus on?

start small,Think Critical

Start with your crown jewels. What systems would make headlines if they got compromised? Your domain controllers, financial databases, customer data repositories - these are your priority targets. Don’t worry about collecting logs from every single workstation yet.

Here’s what I typically recommend for the first phase:


  Domain controllers (authentication events)
  Critical database servers (access and query logs)
  External-facing web servers (access logs and application events)
  Firewalls and perimeter security devices
  Key business applications


Priority 1: Domain Controllers (Security logs, System logs)
Priority 2: Critical application servers (Application logs, Security logs)
Priority 3: Jump boxes and admin workstations (Security logs, PowerShell logs)



Building Your Foundatio

This is where most teams mess up. They skip the boring organisational work and jump straight to writing detection rules. Don’t make this mistake.

Create a naming standard before you deploy anything. When you’re dealing with thousands of devices, “NYC-DC-01” is infinitely more useful than “Shubhendu’s Server.” Trust me on this one.

Your tagging strategy should be simple but consistent. Think about how you’ll search for things six months from now:


  Environment (Production, Staging, Development)
  Location (if you have multiple sites)
  Criticality (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  Owner (which team is responsible)


Naming the best practice should tell a story e.g.:-

DC-NYC-PRIMARY instead of WIN-SRV-001

DB-CUSTOMER-PROD instead of SQL-BOX-02


Detection and Alerting

High Fidelity First

You’re goal isn’t to catch everything-it’s to catch the things that matter without burning out your team


  
    
      Alert Type
      Description / Notes
    
  
  
    
      Failed admin logins
      More than 5 in 10 minutes
    
    
      Service account lockouts
      These should never happen
    
    
      Off-hours admin activity
      Define what “off-hours” means for your business
    
    
      New admin account creation
      Every single one should be investigated
    
    
      Failed authentication attempts
      Especially for admin accounts
    
    
      New local administrator account creation
      Should be flagged and reviewed
    
    
      Successful logins from impossible locations
      Indicates potential credential compromise
    
    
      Antivirus detection alerts
      May signal malware or suspicious behavior
    
    
      Firewall blocks to critical servers
      Could indicate attempted unauthorized access
    
  


The False Positive Battle

Expect to spend 60% of your first three months tuning these alerts. That’s normal. Document every tuning decision - your future self will thank you.

Technical Requirements for Stage 1:

Log Agent Deployment

Keep it simple (KISS) approach

Windows: Use the built-in Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) if possible

Linux: Rsyslog or built-in syslog forwarding

Network devices: SIEM vendor’s universal forwarder

Deployment Method: Manual is fine at this stage. Yes, manual. You need to understand what you’re deploying before you automate it.Later use your existing software deployment tools like SCCM , Group Policy etc to push agents automatically. Since Manual installation doesn’t scale and creates gaps in coverage.

Retention: Start with 90 days of hot storage. You can always adjust later based on your needs and budget.

Alerting: Email notifications are fine initially. Focus on getting the detection logic right before you worry about fancy dashboards.

Stage 2: Established Deployments - Scaling Up Intelligently



Once you’ve got your critical systems covered and your team is comfortable with the alert volume, it’s time to expand. But do it strategically.

Expanding Your Collection
Now you can start collecting from riskier systems - the ones that might generate more noise but give you better visibility:


  
    
      Asset Type
      Description / Notes
    
  
  
    
      Domain Controllers
      Include all, not just primary
    
    
      Database Servers
      Include development databases accessing production data
    
    
      Web Servers &amp;amp; Application Servers
      Ensure coverage of both front-end and back-end services
    
    
      Network Appliances
      Firewalls, proxies, load balancers
    
    
      Desktop Computers
      Prioritize privileged users
    
    
      Application Servers
      May be listed separately for emphasis
    
    
      Network Appliances (duplicate)
      Load balancers, proxies (already covered above—consider consolidating)
    
    
      Cloud Infrastructure Logs
      Include logs from cloud-native services and platforms
    
  


The key is to expand gradually. Add one new log source at a time, tune it properly, then move to the next one.

Integration is Everything

This is where your SIEM starts becoming truly powerful. Start connecting it to other security tools:

Asset Knowledge Database Integration: Your SIEM should know which systems are critical, who owns them, and what they’re used for. When you get an alert from “192.168.1.100,” you should immediately see it’s the HR payroll server

Vulnerability Management Integration: When your SIEM knows that WEB-PROD-01 has unpatched critical vulnerabilities, that failed login alert suddenly becomes much more interesting.

Alert Queue Management

You now have two types of alerts:


  
    High-fidelity alerts - These wake people up
  
  
    Medium-fidelity alerts - These get reviewed during business hours
  


The Storage Strategy: Don’t delete the medium-fidelity stuff. Store it in a “warm” storage tier and review it weekly. You’ll find patterns that inform your high-fidelity rules.

Automated Deployment (Finally!)


  SCCM/Group Policy Deployment


Now you can start pushing agents automatically. But please, test in a lab environment first. I once saw an agent update take down half a hospital’s workstations because they didn’t test the new version.

Deployment Strategy:


  
    Test group (5-10 systems)
  
  
    Pilot group (50-100 systems)
  
  
    Phased rollout (25% per week)
  
  
    Full deployment
  


Stage 3: Mature Deployments - Advanced Detection and Response



This is where the magic happens. Your SIEM transforms from a reactive tool into a proactive threat hunting platform.At this stage, you’re collecting logs from everything that matters:


  
    
      Asset Type
      Description / Notes
    
  
  
    
      Desktops
      Yes, all of them—ensure full endpoint coverage
    
    
      Servers
      Includes all production and non-production servers
    
    
      Mobile Device Management (MDM)
      Systems managing mobile endpoints; key for policy enforcement and log collection
    
    
      Mobile Devices
      Covered via MDM integration; includes smartphones and tablets
    
    
      Cloud Services
      AWS CloudTrail, Office 365, Azure, GCP—focus on audit, access, and activity logs
    
    
      Cloud Applications &amp;amp; Infrastructure
      SaaS platforms and IaaS/PaaS environments; include identity, storage, compute logs
    
    
      IoT Devices
      Printers, security cameras, HVAC systems—often overlooked but critical for visibility
    
    
      Operational Technology (OT)
      Industrial control systems, building automation—log collection may require custom setups
    
  


The Challenge: You’re now ingesting 10TB+ per day. Your old parsing rules don’t scale. Now you can start leveraging the advanced features that seemed like science fiction in Stage 1:

Anomaly Detection with Asset Intelligence:-

now your SIEM knows what normal looks like for each user and device,When Shubhendu from Seurity team suddently start accessing HR Database at 3 am, your soc team will get alert.

Behavioral Analytics (UEBA): Track how users and entities behave over time. Detect insider threats, compromised accounts, and advanced persistent threats that traditional signature-based detection misses.

Machine Learning for Threat Detection:


  Beaconing detection: Identify command and control communication patterns
  DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) detection: Catch malware generating random domains
  Lateral movement detection: Track attackers moving through your network


SOAR(Security Orchestration and Automated Response) Integration

orchestrate your entire security response. When a high-severity alert fires:


  Automatically gather additional context
  Check threat intelligence feeds
  Create an incident ticket
  Potentially isolate the affected system
  Notify the appropriate response team


Dynamic and Self-Healing

Your monitoring infrastructure should adapt automatically. New services get discovered and monitored. Agents self-update and self-heal. The system continuously optimizes itself based on the threats it’s seeing.

Shubhendu’s Tips:


  Start Small, Think Big
  Don’t try to jump straight to Stage 3. Each stage builds on the previous one. The organizational and technical foundations you build in Stage 1 are what make the advanced capabilities in Stage 3 possible.
  Budget Realistically
  A mature SIEM is expensive - not just in licensing costs, but in staff time, training, and infrastructure. Plan for this from the beginning.
  Focus on Your Use Cases
  
    Every organization is different. Don’t copy past SIEM architecture from online available data, A financial services company has different monitoring needs than a manufacturing plant. Tailor your approach to your specific threats and compliance requirements.
  
  Measure What Matters


Track metrics that actually matter:


  Mean time to detection (MTTD)
  Mean time to response (MTTR)
  False positive rate
  Alert closure rate
  Analyst satisfaction (yes, this matters!)


Don’t get caught up in vanity metrics like “events per second”(EPS) that don’t correlate with security outcomes.The best SIEM in the world is useless if your analysts can’t use it effectively. Invest in training and usable interfaces.Please don’t treat your SIEM as “Set and Forget”, keep tuning, keep learning, keep troubleshooting!
